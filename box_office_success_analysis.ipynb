    "The project analysis goal is to provide insights to Microsoft for a new movie studio on what types of films are currently successful at the box office. I will analyze a movie dataset from [The Movie Data Base](https://www.themoviedb.org/) website to identify key trends and patterns, ultimately providing actionable recommendations. Microsoft can use this analysis to decide on what type of film to create."

    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I will explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I will then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create. Objectives:\n",
    "- Identify genres that are performing well at the box office.\n",
    "- Determine key attributes associated with successful films.\n",
    "- Provide three actionable recommendations for the new movie studio."
